    "### Title: Clustering in Marketing: Unveiling Patterns in Urban Demographics\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part A - Slide Contents and Brief Discussion:\n",
    "- **Clustering U.S. Cities for Marketing Insights**\n",
    "  - **Concept**: Cluster analysis groups cities based on demographic similarities to unveil patterns useful in marketing research, advertising, and sales strategies.\n",
    "  - **Application**: By identifying demographically similar clusters, marketers can tailor advertising campaigns and product offerings to meet the specific needs of each group.\n",
    "  - **Real-World Example**: Suppose a company aims to launch a new product in U.S. cities. Using cluster analysis, they discover four distinct demographic clusters. For Atlanta, with a high percentage of Black population, a different marketing approach is applied compared to a city with a higher Hispanic or Asian demographic. This targeted strategy ensures more effective advertising and better market penetration.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part B1 - MS Excel Practice/Exercise/Steps:\n",
    "- **Excel File**: `cluster.xlsx`\n",
    "- **Steps for Standardizing Demographic Attributes**:\n",
    "  1. Open `cluster.xlsx` and navigate to the sheet with demographic data.\n",
    "  2. To compute the mean for the Black percentage, enter `=AVERAGE(C10:C58)` in cell C1.\n",
    "  3. For the standard deviation of Black percentages, use `=STDEV(C10:C58)` in cell C2.\n",
    "  4. Copy these formulas across D1:G2 to calculate the mean and standard deviation for each demographic attribute.\n",
    "  5. In cell I10, calculate the standardized percentage of Blacks for Albuquerque by using `=STANDARDIZE(C10, C$1, C$2)`.\n",
    "  6. Extend this formula from I10 to N58 to compute z-scores for all cities and attributes.\n",
    "- **Troubleshooting Tips**:\n",
    "  - Ensure formulas are correctly copied to reflect each attribute's specific column references.\n",
    "  - Verify the mean and standard deviation calculations by comparing with manual computations for accuracy.\n",
