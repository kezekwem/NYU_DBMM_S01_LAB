        "\n",
        "Understanding data types is fundamental for marketing analysts to effectively structure and query data within a database. Different SQL systems support various data types, but here we'll focus on common SQL data types and those specific to SQLite3.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Common SQL Data Types:**\n",
        "- **Numeric:** Integers (`INT`), decimals (`DECIMAL`), floating-point (`FLOAT`), and auto-incrementing numbers (`IDENTITY` in SQL Server, `AUTOINCREMENT` in SQLite for `INTEGER`).\n",
        "- **Character:** Fixed-length (`CHAR`) and variable-length strings (`VARCHAR`), useful for storing text data like names, addresses, or descriptions.\n",
        "- **Date and Time:** Date (`DATE`), time (`TIME`), and both (`DATETIME`), essential for tracking event times, campaign durations, or customer transactions.\n",
        "- **Binary:** Binary data types (`BINARY`, `VARBINARY`) for storing binary data such as images or file blobs.\n",
        "- **Boolean:** A `BOOLEAN` type representing true or false, practical for flags and switches in marketing campaigns.\n",
        "\n",
        "**SQLite3 Specific Data Types:**\n",
        "- **INTEGER:** The primary integer data type in SQLite. It can be auto-incremented.\n",
        "- **TEXT:** Equivalent to `VARCHAR` in SQL; used to store text data.\n",
        "- **BLOB:** For binary data; SQLite does not distinguish between `BLOB` and text data types, and it stores all data exactly as provided.\n",
        "- **REAL:** The floating-point numeric data type in SQLite, similar to `FLOAT` or `DOUBLE` in SQL.\n",
        "- **NUMERIC:** General numeric type that can store `INT`, `REAL`, `DECIMAL`, and boolean values. SQLite uses dynamic typing and can store any data type in `NUMERIC`.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Real-World Application in Marketing:**\n",
        "- **INTEGER:** Ideal for unique customer IDs or transaction numbers.\n",
        "- **TEXT:** Used for storing customer feedback or product descriptions.\n",
        "- **REAL and NUMERIC:** Perfect for financial calculations like budgeting, ROI analysis, or sales data.\n",
        "- **DATE and TIME:** Vital for campaign planning, tracking sale periods, or customer purchase history.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Type Affinity in SQLite3:**\n",
        "SQLite3 uses a concept called \"type affinity\" on column definitions, which is a recommended type rather than a strict one. This flexibility allows the database to store any type of data in any type of column but recommends a particular data type for each column based on the column's declared type.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Best Practices for Marketers:**\n",
        "- Choose data types that best reflect the nature of the data and its use in analysis.\n",
        "- Use appropriate types for dates and numbers to ensure accurate sorting, filtering, and calculations.\n",
        "- Store data in the most efficient data type to optimize database size and performance.\n"
